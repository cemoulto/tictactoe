# tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe with offline and multiplayer support.

This simple game is an example of [Web Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) usage.

Uses [oghliner](https://github.com/mozilla/oghliner) for offline support and the [web-push](https://github.com/marco-c/web-push) library to connect the application server to the push server.
